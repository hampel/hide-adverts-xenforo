Hide Adverts for XenForo 2.x
============================

This XenForo 2.x addon adds a permission to control which users can hide adverts, plus a user preference to allow users
to show adverts even if they have permission to hide them

Additional options allow you to hide adverts for specific nodes and for specific usergroups (overrides permissions).
